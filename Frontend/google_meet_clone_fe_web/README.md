This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Notes about meeting layout and pagination

- The meeting grid uses a responsive CSS grid (auto-fit + minmax) so participant tiles shrink to fit the available space.
- To avoid vertical overflow on very large calls, a simple frontend pagination is applied when the participant count exceeds a threshold (PAGE_SIZE = 16 by default). This keeps the UI performant and avoids layout issues while still allowing users to page through participants.
- You can adjust the PAGE_SIZE in `src/app/meeting/[code]/page.tsx` to change how many participants show per page.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
